# Go Secure Coding Guide

## Overview

As the digital economy advances, the use of blockchain technologies and smart contracts is increasingly becoming a crucial component. These technologies are not just revolutionary but also bear significant financial implications. Ensuring the high reliability, safety, and security of smart contracts is paramount, especially given their susceptibility to financial losses through operational errors or attacks.

This Go Secure Coding Guide is designed to enhance the security of software developed in the Go language, which is widely used in blockchain and smart contract applications. By minimizing security threats during development and providing a comprehensive understanding of potential security weaknesses, this guide aims to help developers create more secure and robust applications.

### Purpose of the Guide

This guide focuses on presenting:
- Common security weaknesses in Go software development.
- Best practices to mitigate these weaknesses.
- Examples of both vulnerable and secure coding patterns.
