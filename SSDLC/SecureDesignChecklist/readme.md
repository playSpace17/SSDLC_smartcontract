# Checklist

## Overview
This checklist provides a comprehensive checklist to ensure the secure development of smart contracts throughout their lifecycle. The checklist focuses on embedding security measures into the key phases of the smart contract lifecycleâ€”requirements, coding, and testing. By integrating security into each phase, the checklist helps minimize vulnerabilities and enhance the contract's resilience against attacks. Also, the checklist helps minimize vulnerabilities and enhance the contract's security by preventing vulnerabilities from being introduced, leading to a more secure smart contract.

## Quantitative Security Evaluation

### Weakness Assessment
Uses a structured methodology to evaluate potential security weaknesses, including exploit likelihood and severity of impact.

### Risk Scoring and Ranking
Assigns severity scores to vulnerabilities ranging from low to critical, helping prioritize fixes based on their impact on contract security.

### Continuous Security Metrics
Utilizes metrics to track and improve the security posture throughout the development process, enabling iterative security enhancements.
