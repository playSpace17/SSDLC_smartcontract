# Overview
This repository contains research documents and resources related to smart contract security and formal verification.  
It is structured to provide clear references for each topic, including ZK-based voting systems and formal methods for smart contracts.

# Folder Structure
## `ZK Voting/`
Contains materials related to zero-knowledge–based electronic voting systems.  
A separate README inside the folder provides a brief explanation of the ZK voting model and its formal specification.

# Files
## `Formal Method for Smart Contract.pdf`
A brief technical document explaining how formal methods can be used to verify the correctness and security of smart contracts.  
It covers:
- Why smart contracts need strong correctness guarantees  
- Core smart contract risks (immutability, determinism, automatic execution)  
- Limitations of testing and advantages of formal verification  
- Overview of formal specification and verification methods (e.g., TLA+, Alloy, theorem provers, symbolic execution)  
- How formal models can detect logic errors, security vulnerabilities, and invariance violations before deployment  
- High-level examples of applying formal methods to token contracts, DeFi systems, and policy models  

This document summarizes the role of formal methods in improving the safety and reliability of smart contracts across their entire lifecycle.
